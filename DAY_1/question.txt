Q1.1) Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (		   
      inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Q1.2) Find the duplicate in an array of N integers(0 to n-1)

Q2) Sort an array of 0’s 1’s 2’s without using extra space or sorting algo

Q3) Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. 
	One number from set {1, 2, …n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. 
	Find these two numbers.

Q4) We are given two sorted array. 
	We need to merge these two arrays such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting) 
	are in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. 
	Extra space allowed is O(1).

Q5)  Using kadane's Algo :
	Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional 
	 array of numbers which has the largest sum.

Q6) Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals. Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity.

For example, let the given set of intervals be {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8} }. 
The intervals {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with each other, so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. 
Similarly {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}
