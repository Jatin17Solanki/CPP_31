Q1) Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.
And constant space

Q2) Pascal Triangle

Q3) Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. 
	One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. 
	Find these two numbers.

Q4) Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. 
	If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that 
	inversion count is the maximum.
	Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j

Q5) Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction 
(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
